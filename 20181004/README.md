Some tests of RTK operation of two uBlox M8P on 4 Oct 2018. Location is
at NUIG beside the Corrib river.

Two runs: one at about 12:00 UTC and the other at about 15:00 UTC. The
first run was a static survey (base and rover not moving). The secon
run involved movign the rover along the two sides of a small section
of the river trail.

File osi_gnss_download_20181005055005.zip is Galway/NUIG RINEX downloaded 
from gnss.osi.ie during the time of these tests.
I have been unable to get post-processed RTK working using this base
station.
